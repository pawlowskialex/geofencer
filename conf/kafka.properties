# See http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#brokerconfigs for default values.

# Each broker is uniquely identified by a non-negative integer id.  This id serves as the brokers "name", and allows

# long as it is unique.

# Hostname of broker. If this is set, it will only bind to this address.  If this is not set, it will bind to all

# The maximum size of a message that the server can receive.  It is important that this property be in sync with the
# maximum fetch size your consumers use or else an unruly consumer will be able to publish messages too large for
# consumers to consume.
#
# Be careful with this setting when producing messages in batches with compression enabled.  In such a scenario the
# batch of messages is treated as a single message, and its total size must be smaller than this setting.
